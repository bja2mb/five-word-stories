One summer day, terminal crashed
(*^$#@$%&*^%$&^%$#^&oh no that's a bummer&^%$#@!$!%#^#
Everyone's Launch projects fell apart
ben started sobbing &^%$@#$!%#@$, absolutely inconsolable
Because Launch died, the world
devolved into chaos. >:-( Luckily, there
were nearby aliens led by
their supreme overlord!! Daniel Willson
who leapt out of a
Yellow Lamborghini Aventador, began to %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
give a presentation on presenting.
he talked wayyyyyyy too quickly :/

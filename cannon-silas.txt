There once was a man
who lived in a tree.
He made friends with the
squirrels and a friendly bee.
One day, he was away
on an important mission to
take part in the biggest
international nut and flower heist.
He called his friends, the
bee and squirrel, and they
set off to the Gardens
of Versailles. The wealthiest in
flowers and nuts in the
entire world. They broke in
through the sewers, and managed
to grab hazelnuts and daisies.
They returned to the forest,
and feasted on their spoils.
All creatures of the forest
ate well and befriended him.

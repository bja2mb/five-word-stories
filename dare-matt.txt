One day, Ben and Navya
Ate lots of beans from a can.
The beans were of the finest
color, scent, taste and texture 
So fine in fact, they
made Ben cry himself to
sleep. Navya wanted to console
but was busy with her
pet kangaroo that wouldn't stop
eating Ben's leftovers from yesterday.
Ben was heated at this
roomate of his with the 
incessant alarm not shutting off.

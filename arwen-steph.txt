Once upon a time, there
were kids in a forest
that was not in Kansas
and there was a witch
The witch lived in a
delicious house made of candy
The children gorged on candy.
And the witch ate them
Then a wolf came by,
and he huffed and puffed
and blew the house down.
He then devoured the witch.
He put on the witch's
grandma clothes and laid down
The witch's granddaughter soon arrived
and her full name was
The Little Red Riding Hood.
The wolf prepared his meal.
The girl clicked her heels 3x.
She woke up in Kansas.

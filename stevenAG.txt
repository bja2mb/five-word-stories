one day in tokyo there
was a Hamster blood feud
outside the thrift store and 
the local brocolli vendor's house.
To resolve the issue, the vendor
met with Ben Artuso, the 
hamster's favorite Launch instructor, to 
broker a peace treaty using
coffee as compensation for damages.
The treaty was therefore successful.  
The hamsters never fought again.
